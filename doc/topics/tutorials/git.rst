Introduction to Git
===================

Using a text-based format, especially YAML, provides a powerful platform for
recipe management. Recipes are essentially source code, using a human compiler
rather than a machine compiler. As such, they can benefit from many of the same
tools as computer programming languages. One of these tools that can be
especially powerful in kitchen lab environments and recipe development is
version control. Unfortunately, most cooks are not used to using version
control, especially git.
